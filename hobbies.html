<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    I am a sports enthusiast, i love watching various sports. I 
    passionately follow Cricket and Formula 1. I also make sure to watch 
    tennis grand slams finals(French Open, Wimbeldon, Australian open).
    I have also captained my school girls cricket team in inter school 
    matches. <br/>
    Apart from sports i enjoy reading novels in my leisure time.
    My favourite book that i finished reading recently was Sherlock 
    Holmes (vol.1&2) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
